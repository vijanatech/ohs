Though antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a natural evolutionary phenomenon [1–3], AMU is one of the major drivers of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes. This has been mainly caused by the dramatic increase in antibiotic consumption rates in low-andmiddle-income countries (LMICs).  Antibiotics are becoming increasingly ineffective as drug-resistance spreads globally leading to more difficult to treat infections and death. However, if people do not change the way antibiotics are used now, these new antibiotics will suffer the same fate as the current ones and become ineffective.",e("br",null,null,null,3,null),e("br",null,null,null,3,null),"AMR occurs naturally over time, usually through genetic changes. Antimicrobial resistant organisms are found in people, animals, food, plants and the environment (in water, soil and air). They can spread from person to person or between people and animals, including from food of animal origin. The main drivers of antimicrobial resistance include the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials; lack of access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) for both humans and animals; poor infection and disease prevention and control in health-care facilities and farms;  poor access to quality, affordable medicines, vaccines and diagnostics; lack of awareness and knowledge; and lack of enforcement of legislation.",e("br",null,null,null,3,null),e("br",null,null,null,3,null),"AMR has been declared as one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity.

In addition to death and disability, prolonged illness results in longer hospital stays, the need for more expensive medicines and financial challenges for those impacted.

A major global problem Irrational use of medicines is a major problem worldwide it’s estimated that more than half of all medicines are prescribed, dispensed or sold inappropriately, and that half of all patients fail to take them correctly. The overuse, underuse or misuse of medicines results in wastage of scarce resources and widespread health hazards. Examples of irrational use of medicines include: use of too many medicines per patient (“poly-pharmacy”); inappropriate use of antimicrobials, often in inadequate dosage, for non-bacterial infections; over-use of injections when oral formulations would be more appropriate; failure to prescribe in accordance with clinical guidelines; inappropriate self-medication, often of prescription-only medicines; non-adherence to dosing regimes. OHS propose 12 key interventions to promote more rational use: Establishment of a multidisciplinary national body to coordinate policies on medicine use Use of clinical guidelines Development and use of national essential medicines list Establishment of drug and therapeutics committees in districts and hospitals Inclusion of problem-based pharmacotherapy training in undergraduate curricula Continuing in-service medical education as a licensure requirement Supervision, audit and feedback Use of independent information on medicines Public education about medicines Avoidance of perverse financial incentives Use of appropriate and enforced regulation",3,null)],3,null)],3,null),3,null),e("div",null,{class:"col-lg-6 ","data-aos":"fade-up","data-aos-delay":"400"},e("div",null,{class:"service-item d-flex"},[e("div",null,{class:"icon flex-shrink-0"},e("i",null,{class:"bi bi-binoculars"},null,3,null),3,null),e("div",null,null,[e("h4",null,{class:"title"},e("a",null,{class:"stretched-link",href:"services-details.html"},"Research & Surveillance",3,null),3,null),e("p",null,{class:"description"},"Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum",3,null)],3,null)],3,null),3,null)],3,null),3,null),3,null)],3,null)},3,"eB_0");export{a as s_PlsxT0M1U6c};
